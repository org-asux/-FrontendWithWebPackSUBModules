# HOW-TO: run

```
npm i
npm run container
```

Attention: the `npm i` command will go into the `container`, `cart` and `products` SUB-FOLDERs, and do `npm i` there too!  See topmost `package.json` file for details.

# HOW-TO: run SUB-module "cart"

```
chdir cart
npm i
npm run start
npm run dev
```

# HOW-TO: run SUB-module "products"

Same as for `cart` SUB-Folder.

The End.
